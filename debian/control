Description: DNS Statistics Collector
 DNS Statistics Collector (DSC) is a tool used for collecting and exploring
 statistics from busy DNS servers. It uses a distributed architecture with
 collectors running on or near nameservers sending their data to one or more
 central presenters for display and archiving. Collectors use pcap to sniff
 network traffic. They transmit aggregated data to the presenter as XML data.
