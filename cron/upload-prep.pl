# PURPOSE:
#
# This script copies (links) XML output files from the DSC collector
# to one or more "transfer" directories.  This allows the XML files
# to be sent to multiple "presenter" boxes independently.  If one
# destination is unreachable, XML files accumulate there until
# it becomes available again.  Meanwhile, recent files are still
# sent to the other destinations.


exit 0 if Proc::PID::File->running(dir => '/tmp');

# wait a few seconds for 'dsc' to finish writing its XML files to disk
#
