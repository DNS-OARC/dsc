.TH dsc 1 "@PACKAGE_VERSION@" "DNS Statistics Collector"
.SH NAME
dsc \- DNS Statistics Collector
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dsc
[
.B \-dfpmiTv
]
.I dsc.conf
.SH DESCRIPTION
DNS Statistics Collector (\fIdsc\fR) is a tool used for collecting and
exploring statistics from busy DNS servers.
It can be set up to run on or near nameservers to generate aggregated data
that can then be transported to central systems for processing, displaying
and archiving.

Together with \fBdsc-datatool\fR the aggregated data can be furthur enriched
and converted for import into for example InfluxDB which can then be
accessed by Grafana for visualzation, see this wiki on how to set up that:

will chroot to a directory on startup and output statistics into files in
various formats.

See \fIdsc.conf(5)\fR on how to configure \fIdsc\fR, what formats exists,
their structure and output filenames.

.SH KNOWN ISSUES
This program and/or components uses
.I select(2)
to wait for packets and there may be an internal delay within that call
during startup that results in missed packets.
As a workaround, set
.I pcap_thread_timeout
( see
.I dsc.conf(5)
) to a relevant millisecond timeout with regards to the queries per second
(QPS) received.
For example if your receiving 10 QPS then you have 20 packets per second
(PPS) and if spread out equally over a second you have a packet per 50 ms
which you can use as timeout value.
Since version 2.4.0 the default is 100 ms.
