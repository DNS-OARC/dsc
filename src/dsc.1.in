.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dsc
[
.B \-dfpmiTv
]
.I dsc.conf
.SH DESCRIPTION
DNS Statistics Collector (\fIdsc\fR) is a tool used for collecting and exploring
statistics from busy DNS servers.  It can be used in a distributed
architecture to run collectors on or near nameservers sending their data
to one or more central presenters for display and archiving.

.I dsc
will chroot to a directory on startup and output statistics into files in
various formats.

See \fIdsc.conf(5)\fR on how to configure \fIdsc\fR, what formats exists,
their structure and output filenames.

.SH KNOWN ISSUES
This program and/or components uses
.I select(2)
to wait for packets and there may be an internal delay within that
call during startup that results in missed packets. As a workaround, set
.I pcap_thread_timeout
( see
.I dsc.conf(5)
) to a relevant millisecond timeout with regards to the queries per second
(QPS) received. For example if your receiving 10 QPS then you have 20 packets
per second (PPS) and if spread out equally over a second you have a packet
per 50 ms which you can use as timeout value. Since version 2.4.0 the
default is 100 ms.
