.TH dsc.conf 5 "@PACKAGE_VERSION@" "DNS Statistics Collector"
.SH NAME
dsc.conf \- Configuration for the DNS Statistics Collector
.SH DESCRIPTION
The file
.I dsc.conf
contains defaults for the program
.B dsc(1) .
Each line is a configuration option and may have arguments in the form
.IR "option value;" .
Comment lines must have a hash sign (#) in the first column.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.TP
\fBlocal_address\fR IP ;
Specifies the DNS server's local IP address.  It is used to
determine the direction of an IP packet: sending, receiving,
or other.  You may specify multiple local addresses by repeating
the \fBlocal_address\fR line any number of times.
.TP
\fBrun_dir\fR PATH ;
A directory that will become
.I dsc
current directory
after it starts.  Output files will be written here, as will
any core dumps.
.TP
\fBminfree_bytes\fR BYTES ;
If the filesystem where
.I dsc
writes its output files
does not have at least this much free space, then
.I dsc
will not write the files.  This prevents
.I dsc
from filling up the filesystem.  The files that would have been
written are simply lost and cannot be recovered.  Output files will
be written again when the filesystem has the necessary free space.
.TP
\fBpid_file\fR " FILE " ;
The file where
.I dsc
will store its process id.
.TP
\fBbpf_program\fR " RULE " ;
A Berkeley Packet Filter program string.  You may use this
to further restrict the traffic seen but note that
.I dsc
currently has one indexer that looks at all IP
packets.  If you specify something like \fBudp port 53\fR
that indexer will not work.

However, if you want to monitor multiple DNS servers with
separate
.I dsc
instances on one collector box, then you
may need to use \fBbpf_program\fR to make sure that each
.I dsc
process sees only the traffic it should see.

Note that this directive must go before the \fBinterface\fR
directive because
.I dsc
makes only one pass through
the configuration file and the BPF filter is set when the
interface is initialized.
.TP
\fBinterface\fR IFACE | FILE ;
The interface name to sniff packets from or a pcap file to
read packets from.   You may specify multiple interfaces.
.TP
\fBqname_filter\fR NAME FILTER ;
This directive allows you to define custom filters to match
query names in DNS messages.  Please see section QNAME FILTERS
for more information.
.TP
\fBdatasets\fR NAME TYPE LABEL:FIRST LABEL:SECOND FILTERS [ PARAMETERS ] ;
This directive is the hart of \fBdsc\fR.  However, it is also
the most complex (see section DATASETS).

See section EXAMPLE for a set of defined good datasets which is also
installed as \fBdsc.conf.sample\fR.
.TP
\fBbpf_vlan_tag_byte_order\fR TYPE ;
.I dsc
knows about VLAN tags.  Some operating systems (FreeBSD-4.x) have
a bug whereby the VLAN tag id is byte-swapped.  Valid values for
this directive are \fBhost\fR and \fBnet\fR (the default).  Set
this to \fBhost\fR if you suspect your operating system has the VLAN
tag byte order bug.
.TP
\fBmatch_vlan\fR ID [ ID ... ] ;
A white-space separated list of VLAN identifiers.  If set, only the
packets belonging to these VLANs are analyzed.
.TP
\fBoutput_format\fR FORMAT ;
Specify the output format, can be give multiple times to output in
more then one format.  Default output format is XML, see section
DATA FORMATS and FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS.
.TP
\fBdump_reports_on_exit\fR ;
Dump any remaining report before exiting.

NOTE: Timing in the data files will be off!
.TP
\fBgeoip_v4_dat\fR " FILE " [ OPTION ... ] ;
Specify the GeoIP dat file to open for IPv4 country lookup, see section
GEOIP for options.
.TP
\fBgeoip_v6_dat\fR " FILE " [ OPTION ... ] ;
Specify the GeoIP dat file to open for IPv6 country lookup, see section
GEOIP for options.
.TP
\fBgeoip_asn_v4_dat\fR " FILE " [ OPTION ... ] ;
Specify the GeoIP dat file to open for IPv4 AS number lookup, see section
GEOIP for options.
.TP
\fBgeoip_asn_v6_dat\fR " FILE " [ OPTION ... ] ;
Specify the GeoIP dat file to open for IPv6 AS number lookup, see section
GEOIP for options.
.SH DATASETS
A \fBdataset\fR is a 2-D array of counters.  For example, you
might have a dataset with \*(lqQuery Type\*(rq along one dimension and
\*(lqQuery Name Length\*(rq on the other.  The result is a table that
shows the distribution of query name lengths for each query type.

A dataset has the following format:

\fBdatasets\fR NAME TYPE LABEL:FIRST LABEL:SECOND FILTERS [ PARAMETERS ] ;

.TP
\fBNAME\fR
The name of the dataset, this must be unique and is used in the filename
for the output files.
.TP
\fBTYPE\fR
The protocol layer, available layers are:
.nf
    ip
    dns
.fi
.TP
\fBLABEL\fR
The label of the dimensions.
.TP
\fBFIRST\fR
The indexer for the first dimension, see INDEXERS sections.
.TP
\fBSECOND\fR
The indexer for the second dimension, see INDEXERS sections.
.TP
\fBFILTERS\fR
One or more filters, see FILTERS sections.
.TP
\fBPARAMETERS\fR
Zero or more parameters, see section PARAMETERS.
.LP
.SH "INDEXERS AND FILTERS"
An
.I indexer
is simply a function that transforms the attributes
of an IP/DNS message into an array index.  For some attributes the
transformation is straightforward.  For example, the \*(lqQuery Type\*(rq
indexer simply extracts the query type value from a DNS message and
uses this 16-bit value as the array index.

Other attributes are slightly more complicated.  For example, the
\*(lqTLD\*(rq indexer extracts the TLD of the QNAME field of a DNS message
and maps it to an integer.  The indexer maintains a simple internal
table of TLD-to-integer mappings.  The actual integer values are
unimportant because the TLD strings, not the integers, appear in
the resulting data.

When you specify an indexer on a \fBdataset\fR line, you must
provide both the name of the indexer and a label.  The Label appears
as an attribute in the output.

For example the following line:

.nf
    dataset the_dataset dns Foo:foo Bar:bar queries-only;
.fi

Would produce the following XML output:

.nf
    <array name="the_dataset" dimensions="2" start_time="1091663940" ...
      <dimension number="1" type="Foo"/>
      <dimension number="2" type="Bar"/>
      <data>
        <Foo val="1">
          <Bar val="0" count="4"/>
          ...
          <Bar val="100" count="41"/>
        </Foo>
        <Foo val="2">
          ...
        </Foo>
      </data>
    </array>
.fi
.SH "IP INDEXERS"
.I dsc
includes only minimal support for collecting IP-layer
stats.  Mostly we are interested in finding out the mix of
IP protocols received by the DNS server.  It can also show us
if/when the DNS server is the subject of denial-of-service
attack.
.TP
\fBip_direction\fR
One of three values: \fBsent\fR, \fBrecv\fR or \fBelse\fR.  Direction
is determined based on the setting for \fBlocal_address\fR in the
configuration file.
.TP
\fBip_proto\fR
The IP protocol type, e.g.: \fBtcp\fR, \fBudp\fR or \fBicmp\fR.
Note that the \fBbpf_program\fR setting affects all traffic seen.  If
the program contains the word \*(lqudp\*(rq then you won't see any counts
for non-UDP traffic.
.TP
\fBip_version\fR
The IP version number, e.g.: \fB4\fR or \fB6\fR.  Can be used to
compare how much traffic comes in via IPv6 compared to IPv4.
.SH "IP FILTERS"
Currently there is only one IP protocol filter: \fBany\fR.
It includes all received packets.
.SH "DNS INDEXERS"
.TP
\fBcertain_qnames\fR
This indexer isolates the two most popular query names seen
by DNS root servers: \fIlocalhost\fR and \fI[a--m].root-servers.net\fR.
.TP
\fBclient_subnet\fR
Groups DNS messages together by the subnet of the
client's IP address.  The subnet is masked by /24 for IPv4
and by /96 for IPv6.  We use this to make datasets with
large, diverse client populations more manageable and to
provide a small amount of privacy and anonymization.
.TP
\fBclient\fR
The IP (v4 and v6) address of the DNS client.
.TP
\fBserver\fR
The IP (v4 and v6) address of the DNS server.
.TP
\fBcountry\fR
The country code of the IP (v4 and v6), see section GEOIP.
.TP
\fBasn\fR
The AS (autonomous system) number of the IP (v4 and v6), see section GEOIP.
.TP
\fBdo_bit\fR
This indexer has only two values: 0 or 1.  It indicates
whether or not the \*(lqDO\*(rq bit is set in a DNS query.  According to
RFC 2335: \fISetting the DO bit to one in a query indicates
to the server that the resolver is able to accept DNSSEC
security RRs.\fR
.TP
\fBedns_version\fR
The EDNS version number, if any, in a DNS query.  EDNS
Version 0 is documented in RFC 2671.
.TP
\fBedns_bufsiz\fR
The EDNS buffer size per 512 chunks (0-511, 512-1023 etc).
.TP
\fBidn_qname\fR
This indexer has only two values: 0 or 1.  It returns 1
when the first QNAME in the DNS message question section
is an internationalized domain name (i.e., containing
non-ASCII characters).  Such QNAMEs begin with the string
\fIxn--\fR.  This convention is documented in RFC 3490.
.TP
\fBmsglen\fR
The overall length (size) of the DNS message.
.TP
\fBnull\fR
A \*(lqno-op\*(rq indexer that always returns the same value.
This can be used to effectively turn the 2-D table into a
1-D array.
.TP
\fBopcode\fR
The DNS message opcode is a four-bit field.  QUERY is the
most common opcode.  Additional currently defined opcodes
include: IQUERY, STATUS, NOTIFY, and UPDATE.
.TP
\fBqclass\fR
The DNS message query class (QCLASS) is a 16-bit value.  IN
is the most common query class.  Additional currently defined
query class values include: CHAOS, HS, NONE, and ANY.
.TP
\fBqname\fR
The full QNAME string from the first (and usually only)
QNAME in the question section of a DNS message.
.TP
\fBqnamelen\fR
The length of the first (and usually only) QNAME in a DNS
message question section.  Note this is the \*(lqexpanded\*(rq
length if the message happens to take advantage of DNS
message \*(lqcompression\*(rq.
.TP
\fBqtype\fR
The query type (QTYPE) for the first QNAME in the DNS message
question section.  Well-known query types include: A, AAAA,
A6, CNAME, PTR, MX, NS, SOA, and ANY.
.TP
\fBquery_classification\fR
A stateless classification of \*(lqbogus\*(rq queries:
.RS
.TP
non-auth-tld
When the TLD is not one of the IANA-approved TLDs.
.TP
root-servers.net
A query for a root server IP address.
.TP
localhost
A query for the localhost IP address.
.TP
a-for-root
An \*(lqA\*(rq query for the DNS root (.).
.TP
a-for-a
An \*(lqA\*(rq query for an IPv4 address.
.TP
rfc1918-ptr
A PTR query for an RFC 1918 address.
.TP
funny-class
A query with an unknown/undefined query class.
.TP
funny-qtype
A query with an unknown/undefined query type.
.TP
src-port-zero
When the UDP message's source port equals zero.
.TP
malformed
A malformed DNS message that could not be entirely parsed.
.RE
.TP
\fBrcode\fR
The RCODE value in a DNS response.  The most common response
codes are 0 (NO ERROR) and 3 (NXDOMAIN).
.TP
\fBrd_bit\fR
This indexer returns 1 if the RD (recursion desired) bit is
set in the query.  Usually only stub resolvers set the RD bit.
Usually authoritative servers do not offer recursion to their
clients.
.TP
\fBtc_bit\fR
This indexer returns 1 if the TC (truncated) bit is
set (in a response).  An authoritative server sets the TC bit
when the entire response won't fit into a UDP message.
.TP
\fBtld\fR
The TLD of the first QNAME in a DNS message's question section.
.TP
\fBsecond_ld\fR
The Second LD of the first QNAME in a DNS message's question section.
.TP
\fBthird_ld\fR
The Third LD of the first QNAME in a DNS message's question section.
.TP
\fBtransport\fR
Indicates whether the DNS message is carried via UDP or TCP.
.TP
\fBdns_ip_version\fR
The IP version number that carried the DNS message.
.TP
\fBdns_source_port\fR
The source port of the DNS message.
.TP
\fBdns_sport_range\fR
The source port of the DNS message per 1024 chunks (0-1023, 1024-2047 etc).
.TP
\fBqr_aa_bits\fR
The "qr_aa_bits" dataset may be useful when \fBdsc\fR is monitoring
an authoritative name server.  This dataset counts the number of DNS
messages received with each combination of QR,AA bits.  Normally
the authoritative name server should *receive* only *queries*.  If
the name server is the target of a DNS reflection attack, it will
probably receive DNS *responses* which have the QR bit set.
.SH "DNS FILTERS"
You must specify one or more of the following filters (separated
by commas) on the \fBdataset\fR line. Note that multiple filters
are \fIAND\fRed together.  That is, they narrow the input stream, rather
than broaden it.
.TP
\fBany\fR
The no-op filter, counts all messages.
.TP
\fBqueries-only\fR
Count only DNS query messages.  A query is a DNS message
where the QR bit is set to 0.
.TP
\fBreplies-only\fR
Count only DNS response messages.  A query is a DNS message
where the QR bit is set to 1.
.TP
\fBnxdomains-only\fR
Count only NXDOMAIN responses.
.TP
\fBpopular-qtypes\fR
Count only DNS messages where the query type is one of:
A, NS, CNAME, SOA, PTR, MX, AAAA, A6, ANY.
.TP
\fBidn-only\fR
Count only DNS messages where the query name is in the
internationalized domain name format.
.TP
\fBaaaa-or-a6-only\fR
Count only DNS messages where the query type is AAAA or A6.
.TP
\fBroot-servers-net-only\fR
Count only DNS messages where the query name is within
the \fIroot-servers.net\fR domain.
.TP
\fBchaos-class\fR
Counts only DNS messages where QCLASS is equal to CHAOS (3).  The
CHAOS class is generally used for only the special \fIhostname.bind\fR
and \fIversion.bind\fR queries.
.TP
\fBpriming-query\fR
Count only DNS messages where the query type is NS and QNAME is \*(lq.\*(rq.
.SH "QNAME FILTERS"
Defines a custom QNAME-based filter for DNS messages.  If you
refer to this named filter on a dataset line, then only queries
or replies for matching QNAMEs will be counted.  The QNAME
argument is a regular expression.  For example:

.nf
    qname_filter WWW-Only ^www\. ;
    dataset qtype dns All:null Qtype:qtype queries-only,WWW-Only ;
.fi
.SH PARAMETERS
.I dsc
currently supports the following optional parameters:
.TP
\fBmin-count\fR=NN
Cells with counts less than \fBNN\fR are not included in
the output.  Instead, they are aggregated into the special
values \fI-:SKIPPED:-\fR and \fI-:SKIPPED_SUM:-\fR.
This helps reduce the size of datasets with a large number
of small counts.
.TP
\fBmax-cells\fR=NN
A different, perhaps better, way of limiting the size
of a dataset.  Instead of trying to determine an appropriate
\fBmin-count\fR value in advance, \fBmax-cells\fR
allows you put a limit on the number of cells to
include for the second dataset dimension.  If the dataset
has 9 possible first-dimension values, and you specify
a \fBmax-cell\fR count of 100, then the dataset will not
have more than 900 total values.  The cell values are sorted
and the top \fBmax-cell\fR values are output.  Values
that fall below the limit are aggregated into the special
\fI-:SKIPPED:-\fR and \fI-:SKIPPED_SUM:-\fR entries.
.SH "FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS"
The filename is in the format:
.nf
    ${timestamp}.dscdata.${format}
.fi

For example:
.nf
    1154649660.dscdata.xml
.fi
.SH "DATA FORMATS"
.TP
\fBXML\fR
A dataset XML file has the following structure:
.RE

.nf
<array name="dataset-name" dimensions="2" start_time="unix-seconds"
        stop_time="unix-seconds">
  <dimension number="1" type="Label1"/>
  <dimension number="2" type="Label2"/>
  <data>
    <Label1 val="D1-V1">
      <Label2 val="D2-V1" count="N1"/>

      <Label2 val="D2-V3" count="N3"/>
    </Label1>
    <Label1 val="D1-V2">

      <Label2 val="D2-V2" count="N2"/>
      <Label2 val="D2-V3" count="N3"/>
    </Label1>
  </data>
</array>
.fi
.TP
\fBJSON\fR
A dataset JSON file has the following structure:
.RE

.nf
{
  "name": "dataset-name",
  "start_time": unix-seconds,
  "stop_time": unix-seconds,
  "dimensions": [ "Label1", "Label2" ],
  "data": [
    {
      "Label1": "D1-V1",
      "Label2": [
        { "val": "D2-V1", "count": N1 },
        { "val": "D2-V2", "count": N2 },
        { "val": "D2-V3", "count": N3 }
      ]
    },
    {
      "Label1": "D1-V2-base64",
      "base64": true,
      "Label2": [
        { "val": "D2-V1", "count": N1 },
        { "val": "D2-V2-base64", "base64": true, "count": N2 },
        { "val": "D2-V3", "count": N3 }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
.fi

\fBdataset-name\fR, \fBLabel1\fR, and \fBLabel2\fR come from the
dataset definition.

The \fBstart_time\fR and \fBstop_time\fR attributes
are given in Unix seconds.  They are normally 60-seconds apart.
.I dsc
usually starts a new measurement interval on 60 second
boundaries.  That is:

.nf
    stop_time mod{60} == 0
.fi

The \fBLabel1\fR attributes (\fID1-V1\fR, \fID1-V2\fR) are
values for the first dimension indexer.  Similarly, the \fBLabel2\fR
attributes (\fID2-V1\fR, \fID2-V2\fR \fID2-V3\fR) are values for the
second dimension indexer.  For some indexers these values are numeric,
for others they are strings.  If the value contains certain non-printable
characters, the string is base64-encoded and the optional BASE64
attribute is set to 1/true.

There are two special \fBval\fRs that help keep large datasets down
to a reasonable size: \fI-:SKIPPED:-\fR and
\fI-:SKIPPED_SUM:-\fR.  These may be present on datasets that use
the \fImin-count\fR and \fImax-cells\fR parameters (see section
PARAMETERS).  \fI-:SKIPPED:-\fR is the number of cells that were not
included in the output.  \fI-:SKIPPED_SUM:-\fR, is the sum of the
counts for all the skipped cells.

Note that \*(lqone-dimensional datasets\*(rq still use two dimensions in
the output.  The first dimension type and value will be \*(lqAll\*(rq as shown
in the example below:

.nf
    <array name="rcode" dimensions="2" start_time="1154649600"
            stop_time="1154649660">
      <dimension number="1" type="All"/>
      <dimension number="2" type="Rcode"/>
      <data>
        <All val="ALL">
          <Rcode val="0" count="70945"/>
          <Rcode val="3" count="50586"/>
          <Rcode val="4" count="121"/>
          <Rcode val="1" count="56"/>
          <Rcode val="5" count="44"/>
        </All>
      </data>
    </array>
.fi

The \fBcount\fR values are always integers.  If the count for
a particular tuple is zero, it should not be included in the output.

Note that the contents of the output do not indicate where it
came from.  In particular, the server and node that it came from
are not present.
.SH GEOIP
Country code and AS number lookup is available using MaxMind GeoIP Legacy
API if it was enabled during compilation.

Multiple options can be give to the database and are directly linked
to the options for \fIGeoIP_open()\fR but without the prefix of
\fBGEOIP_\fR, example:

.nf
    geoip_v4_dat "/usr/local/share/GeoIP/GeoIP.dat" STANDARD MEMORY_CACHE;
    geoip_asn_v6_dat "/usr/local/share/GeoIP/GeoIPASNumv6.dat" MEMORY_CACHE;
.fi

GeoIP documentation says:
.TP
\fBSTANDARD\fR
Read database from file system. This uses the least memory.
.TP
\fBMEMORY_CACHE\fR
Load database into memory. Provides faster performance but uses more memory.
.TP
\fBCHECK_CACHE\fR
Check for updated database. If database has been updated, reload file
handle and/or memory cache.
.TP
\fBINDEX_CACHE\fR
Cache only the the most frequently accessed index portion of the database,
resulting in faster lookups than GEOIP_STANDARD, but less memory usage
than GEOIP_MEMORY_CACHE. This is useful for larger databases such as
GeoIP Legacy Organization and GeoIP Legacy City. Note: for GeoIP Legacy
Country, Region and Netspeed databases, GEOIP_INDEX_CACHE is equivalent
to GEOIP_MEMORY_CACHE.
.TP
\fBMMAP_CACHE\fR
Load database into mmap shared memory. MMAP is not available for
32bit Windows.
