.SH NAME
dsc-psl-convert \- Convert Public Suffix List (PSL) to DSC TLD List
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dsc-psl-convert
[
.B options
]
[
.I PSL file
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Convert Public Suffix List (PSL) to DSC TLD List (stdout).

If the PSL is not specified then it will use the one installed on the system,
for example on Debian/Ubuntu the package publicsuffix will be installed
in /usr/share/publicsuffix.

If "-" is given as file then it will read from stdin.

The PSL can also be downloaded from https://publicsuffix.org/ .

The PSL will be converted to the TLD list format (see dsc.conf(5)) as follows:
.RS
.TP
* Exceptions (!name) are ignored
.TP
* Singel label suffixes are ignored
.TP
* Wildcards (*.) are removed before processing
.TP
* All labels will be encoded in IDN/punycode
.RE
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-all
Include all names found in the PSL file.
Default is to stop after ICANN domains (===END ICANN DOMAINS===).
.TP
.B \-\-no\-skip\-idna\-err
Report errors when trying to convert international domain names into ASCII
(punycode).
Default is to ignore these errors.
.TP
.BR \-h "|" \-\-help
Show help and exit.
.SH OUTPUT FORMAT
The output format that is used for DSC's
.I tld_list
conf option is simply one line per suffix.
It also supports commenting out an entry with #.

For example:

.EX
  co.uk
  net.au
  #net.cn
.EE
.SH EXAMPLE SETUP
This example fetches the Public Suffix List and converts it in-place to
a DSC TLD list, stores it in /etc/dsc and configures DSC to use that.

.EX
  wget -O - https://publicsuffix.org/list/public_suffix_list.dat | \\
    dsc-psl-convert - > /etc/dsc/tld.list
  echo "tld_list /etc/dsc/tld.list;" >> /etc/dsc/dsc.conf
