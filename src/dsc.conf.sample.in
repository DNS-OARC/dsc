# local_address
#
#  Specifies a local IP address with an optional mask/bits for local
#  networks.  Used to determine the "direction" of an IP packet: sending
#  or receiving or other. Repeat any number of times for all local
#  addresses.

# run_dir
#
#  dsc passes this directory to chdir() after starting.
#

#
#  If the filesystem has less than this amount of free

# pid_file
#
#  filename where DSC should store its process-id
#
pid_file "@DSC_PID_FILE@";

# bpf_program
#
#  a berkely packet filter program.  it can be used to limit
#  the number and type of queries that the application receives
#  from the kernel.  note if you limit it to "udp port 53" the
#  IP-based collectors do not work
#
#  NOTE: bpf_program must GO BEFORE interface
#
#  use this to see only DNS messages
#bpf_program "udp port 53";
#
#  use this to see only DNS *queries*
#bpf_program "udp dst port 53 and udp[10:2] & 0x8000 = 0";

# dns_port
#
#  DSC will only parse traffic coming to or leaving the DNS port (default 53),
#  this option lets you control which port that is in case it's not standard.
#dns_port 53;

# pcap_buffer_size
#
#  Set the buffer size (in bytes) for pcap, increasing this may help
#  if you see dropped packets by the kernel but increasing it too much
#  may have other side effects
#
#  NOTE: pcap_buffer_size must GO BEFORE interface
#pcap_buffer_size 4194304;

# pcap_thread_timeout
#
#  Set the internal timeout pcap-thread uses when waiting for packets,
#  the default is 100 ms.

# drop_ip_fragments
#
#  Drop all packets that are fragments
#
#  NOTE: drop_ip_fragments must GO BEFORE interface
#drop_ip_fragments;

# interface
#
#  specifies a network interface to sniff packets from or a pcap
#  file to read packets from, can specify more than one.
#
#  Under Linux (kernel v2.2+) libpcap can use an "any" interface which
#  will include any interfaces the host has but these interfaces will
#  not be put into promiscuous mode which may prevent capturing traffic
#  that is not directly related to the host.
#

#interface fxp0;
#interface any;

# DNSTAP
#
#  specify DNSTAP input from a file, UNIX socket, UDP or TCP connections
#  (dsc will listen for incoming connections).
#
#  This type of input is delivered directly from the DNS software itself
#  as encapsulated DNS packets as seen or as made by the software.
#  See https://dnstap.info for more information about DNSTAP.
#
#  dnstap_unixsock can have additional optional options to control access
#  to the socket: [user][:group] [umask]
#
#    dnstap_unixsock /path/to/unix.sock user:group 0007;
#
#  NOTE:
#  - Only one DNSTAP input can be specified at a time currently.
#  - Configuration needs to match that of the DNS software.
#  - Don't use these values as default values, no default port for DNSTAP!

# DNSTAP network information filler
#
#  per DNSTAP specification, some information may be not included such as
#  receiver or sender of DNS. To be able to produce statistics, dsc needs
#  to know what to put in place when that information is missing.
#  This is configured by dnstap_network and should be the primary IP
#  addresses and port of the DNS software.

#  you refer to this named filter on a dataset line, then only
#  queries or replies for matching QNAMEs will be counted.

#
#  Do not wait on interval sync to start capturing, normally DSC will

# Response Time indexer
#
#  These settings are for the response time indexer, it tracks query

#  took to answer the query.

#  Available statistical output modes:
#  - bucket
#  - log10 (default)
#  - log2
#
#response_time_mode log10;

#
#  If the number of queries tracked exceeds max_queries the full_mode
#  will control how to handle it:
#  - drop_query: Drop the incoming query.
#  - drop_oldest: Drop the oldest query being tracked and accept the
#                 incoming one.
#
#response_time_full_mode drop_query;
#
#  Set the maximum seconds to keep a query but a query can still be
#  matched to a response while being outside this limit and therefor
#  there is a mode on how to handle that situation:
#  - ceil: The query will be counted as successful but the time it took
#          will be the maximum seconds (think ceiling, or ceil()).
#  - timed_out: The query will be counted as timed out.
#
#response_time_max_seconds 5;
