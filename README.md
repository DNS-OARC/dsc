DNS Statistics Collector (DSC) is a tool used for collecting and exploring
statistics from busy DNS servers.  It uses a distributed architecture with
collectors running on or near nameservers sending their data to one or more
central presenters for display and archiving.  Collectors use pcap to sniff
network traffic.  They transmit aggregated data to the presenter as XML data.

DNS Statistics Presenter can be found here:

## Dependencies

`dsc` requires a couple of libraries beside a normal C compiling
environment with autoconf, automake, libtool and pkgconfig.

`dsc` has a non-optional dependency on the PCAP library and optional
dependency on the GeoIP library (for the `asn` and `country` indexer).

To install the dependencies under Debian/Ubuntu:
```
apt-get install -y libpcap-dev libproc-pid-file-perl
```

To install the dependencies under CentOS (with EPEL enabled):
```
yum install -y libpcap-devel perl-Proc-PID-File
```

To install the dependencies under FreeBSD 10+ using `pkg`:
```
pkg install -y libpcap p5-Proc-PID-File
```

To install the dependencies under OpenBSD 5+ using `pkg_add`:
```
pkg_add p5-Proc-PID-File
```

NOTE: It is recommended to install the PCAP library from source/ports on
OpenBSD since the bundled version is an older and modified version.

### DNSTAP support

To enable DNSTAP support, first install the necessary dependencies and
then run `configure` with `--enable-dnstap`.

- Debian/Ubuntu: `apt-get install -y libdnswire-dev libuv1-dev`
- CentOS: `yum install -y dnswire-devel libuv-devel`
- FreeBSD: `pkg install -y libuv`
- OpenBSD: `pkg_add libuv`

`dnswire` packages for Debian, Ubuntu and CentOS exists at
[https://dev.dns-oarc.net/packages/](https://dev.dns-oarc.net/packages/),
for other distributions please see
[https://github.com/DNS-OARC/dnswire](https://github.com/DNS-OARC/dnswire).

## Building from source tarball

The [source tarball from DNS-OARC](https://www.dns-oarc.net/dsc/download)
comes prepared with `configure`:

```
tar zxvf dsc-version.tar.gz
cd dsc-version
./configure [options]
make
make install
```

NOTE: If building fails on FreeBSD/OpenBSD, try adding these configure
options: `--with-extra-cflags="-I /usr/local/include" --with-extra-ldflags="-L/usr/local/lib"`.

## Building from Git repository

If you are building `dsc` from it's Git repository you will first need
to initiate the Git submodules that exists and later create autoconf/automake
files, this will require a build environment with autoconf, automake, libtool
and pkgconfig to be installed.

```
git clone https://github.com/DNS-OARC/dsc.git
cd dsc
git submodule update --init
./autogen.sh
./configure [options]
make
make install
```

NOTE: If building fails on FreeBSD/OpenBSD, try adding these configure
options: `--with-extra-cflags="-I /usr/local/include" --with-extra-ldflags="-L/usr/local/lib"`.

## Puppet

John Bond at ICANN DNS Engineering team has developed a puppet module for DSC,
the module and code can be found here:
